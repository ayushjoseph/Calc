Calc 

A Modern Android Calculator Calculy is a sleek and functional calculator application for Android, built from the ground up to demonstrate modern, professional-grade development practices. This project utilizes a native stack with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, showcasing a clean, declarative UI and a robust, state-driven architecture. It serves as a strong portfolio piece, highlighting the ability to build polished and maintainable apps using the latest industry standards, providing a clear example of current Android development workflows.

About This Project This app was developed as a hands-on exercise to master the latest Android development paradigm. While it provides a simple interface for essential arithmetic, its true purpose is to showcase best practices. The primary goal was building a complete app while prioritizing code quality, a scalable architecture, and adherence to Google's recommended patterns. The result is an application that is not only useful but also serves as a clean, well-documented codebase for other developers to learn from and review.

Features Standard Arithmetic Operations: Reliably perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Responsive Declarative UI: Built with Jetpack Compose, the UI adapts cleanly to various screen sizes and orientations, requiring less code than traditional XML layouts.

Instant Clear and Reset: A dedicated 'C' button allows users to instantly clear all inputs and reset the calculator state for a new calculation.

Real-time Display: The input expression and final result are shown on a large, clean, easy-to-read display, improving user experience.

Robust Error Handling: Includes foundational error handling for invalid operations like division by zero, preventing app crashes and providing clear user feedback.

Tech Stack & Architecture Language: Kotlin: The official language for Android. Its conciseness and null-safety features enable safer and more readable code.

UI Toolkit: Jetpack Compose: Google's recommended declarative UI toolkit. This allows building the UI directly in Kotlin, accelerating development and simplifying complex UIs.

Architecture: State-Driven UI: A pattern where the UI is a direct function of the application state, managed within Composables using remember and mutableStateOf for efficient UI updates.

IDE: Android Studio

Build System: Gradle

Future Enhancements This project is actively being improved. Planned future features include:

[ ] Decimal Point Support: Implementing logic for floating-point calculations.

[ ] Backspace Functionality: Adding a button to delete the last entered digit for easier corrections.

[ ] Advanced Operations: Expanding capabilities with functions like percentages and square roots.

[ ] Calculation History: A view to see a log of recent calculations.

[ ] Enhanced UI/UX: Introducing custom themes (including a dark mode) and button animations.
